With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in \"actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law\".\n The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance.\n In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers.\n There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak in the sense that they are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance.\n 'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law.\n The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions.\n CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.\nGreisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin limit\nThe Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin limit (GZK limit) is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic rays (high energy charged particles from space) coming from \"distant\" sources.\n The limit is , or about 8\u00a0joules.\n The limit is set by slowing-interactions of cosmic ray protons with the microwave background radiation over long distances (~160 million light-years).\n The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected.\n For example, one extreme-energy cosmic ray has been detected which appeared to possess a record (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 60\u00a0mph baseball).\n","problem":"What does the Hacker-Pschorr Brewery have to limit in order to comply with German regulations?","answer":"ingredients in beer"}

{"context":"Parallel key\nIn music, a major scale and a minor scale that have the same tonic are called parallel keys and are said to be in a parallel relationship.\n The parallel minor or tonic minor of a particular major key is the minor key based on the same tonic; similarly the parallel major has the same tonic as the minor key (from the Greek, \"para alleilos\", \"beside each other\").\n For example, G major and G minor have different modes but both have the same tonic, G; so we say that G minor is the parallel minor of G major.\n In contrast, a major scale and a minor scale that have the same key signature (and therefore different tonics) are called relative keys.\nPaloma (cocktail)\nThe paloma (Spanish for \"dove\") is a tequila-based cocktail.\n This drink is most commonly prepared by mixing tequila with a grapefruit-flavored soda such as Fresca, Squirt, or Jarritos and served on the rocks with a lime wedge.\n This drink also has the option of adding salt to the rim of the glass.\nSazerac Company\nThe Sazerac Company is a large privately held alcoholic beverages company with headquarters in Metairie, Louisiana (in the New Orleans metropolitan area).\n Its distilleries include the Barton Brands distillery (in Bardstown, Kentucky), the Buffalo Trace Distillery (in Frankfort, Kentucky), the former Glenmore Distillery (now a bottling plant in Owensboro, Kentucky), and the A.

{"context":"Dinaric calcareous block fir forest\nThe Dinaric calcareous silver fir forests are an endemic vegetation type of the littoral Dinaric Alps, located in southeastern Europe.\n Pure stands of Dinaric calcareous Silver fir \u2014\"Abies alba\" forests appear on limestone escarpments in the montane zones of Orjen, Velebit, Biokovo and Prenj.\n They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests bear several rare plants and are of striking beauty.\n As a highly endemic and rare vegetation type of the Dinarids it needs protection.\nKniphofia\nKniphofia , also called tritoma, red hot poker, torch lily, knofflers or poker plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae, first described as a genus in 1794.\n It is native to Africa.\n Herbaceous species and hybrids have narrow, grass-like leaves 10 - long, while perennial species have broader, strap-shaped foliage up to 1.5 m long.\n All plants produce spikes of upright, brightly coloured flowers well above the foliage, in shades of red, orange and yellow, often bicoloured.\n The flowers produce copious nectar while blooming and are attractive to bees.\n In the New World they may attract sap-suckers such as hummingbirds and New World orioles.\nCaatinga\nCaatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy).\n It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an ecoregion characterized by this vegetation in interior northeastern Brazil.\n The name \"Caatinga\" is a Tupi word meaning \"white forest\" or \"white vegetation\" (\"caa\" = forest, vegetation, \"tinga\" = white).\nLourensford Alluvium Fynbos\nLourensford Alluvium Fynbos is a critically endangered vegetation type that is endemic to Cape Town.\n Though closest to Fynbos, it has characteristics of both Fynbos and Renosterveld vegetation and is thus actually a unique hybrid vegetation type.\nDesert dry wash\nDesert dry wash is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the flat bottoms of canyons and drainages that lack water at or near the surface most of the year, and are subject to periodic severe flooding events.\n Desert dry wash is contrasted with desert riparian vegetation, which occurs in desert canyons and drainages where there is year-round water at or near the surface.\n Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event.\n Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event.\n They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding.\n Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (\"Psorothamnus spinosus\"), desert willow (\"Chilopsis linearis\"), catclaw (\"Senegalia greggii\"), cheesebush (\"Ambrosia salsola\"), and waterweed (\"Baccharis sergiloides\").\nBaptisia\nBaptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae.\n They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated.\n They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America.\n The species most commonly found in cultivation is \"B. australis\".\nDesert riparian\nDesert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.\n It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.\n The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.\n The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.\n Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.\n Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\").\n Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.\n Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.\nVegetation and slope stability\nVegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.\n The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.\n Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.\n There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.\nVegetation classification\nVegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.\n Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.\n Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.\n In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.\n Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.\n Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.\nWildfire\nA wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.\n Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.\n Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.\n Wildfire\u2019s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.\n Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.\n","problem":"What type of vegetation does Kniphofia and Baptisia have in common?","answer":"plant"}

Grand Prix was essentially a Veritas Formula Two car.\n The car was owned and prepared by the noted German racing driver Hans Klenk who intended to race it himself in the Grand Prix.\n However, Klenk's career as a racing driver came to an end when he suffered injuries in an accident while working as a test driver for Mercedes-Benz.\n The car was driven in the Grand Prix by another German, Theo Helfrich.\n He retired on lap 9 with engine failure.\nRacing helmet\nA racing helmet is a form of protective headgear worn by racing car and rally drivers.\n Motor racing has long been known to be an exceptionally risky sport: sudden deceleration forces on the head can easily occur if a racing car loses control at the very high speeds of competitive motor racing or the rough terrain experienced in rallying.\n A risk more nearly unique to motor racing is the possibility of drastically severe burns from fuel igniting when the fuel lines or fuel tank of the vehicle are jolted sufficiently to dislodge or breach them in a situation in which the driver cannot soon enough escape from his car.\n This happened to world champion driver Niki Lauda at the 1976 German Grand Prix

coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.\n The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.\n The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.\n From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.\n Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.\n This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going

{"context":"Emo\nEmo is a genre of rock music characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics.\n It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by Washington, D.C. hardcore bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.\n However, as the genre was taken up by a new generation of musicians in the early 1990s, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk by bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, and Jimmy Eat World.\n By the mid-1990s, numerous emo acts such as Braid, The Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre.\n Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow.\nDie anderen Bands\nDie anderen Bands (] , \"the other bands\") is a term combining alternative music bands of 1980s GDR (East Germany).\n They shared a more or less open criticism of their country's political system, and a high degree of creativity which was lacking from the more established music scene of East Germany.\n Many members of these bands played significant parts during the time of political change \"Wende\" in 1989.\n The bands came from a broad range of musical genres, especially Punk, Blues, Wave, Indie and Electronic music.\nLines Across Maps\nLines Across Maps are a British math rock band based in Lincolnshire, England.\n Their music is characterized by a use of complex time signatures and heavy, guitar driven sounds.\n In December 2011, shortly after the release of their debut EP, Stuart Smith of This Town Needs Guns described the band as \"a lot like Colour (now defunct UK math rock band)\".\n The name Lines Across Maps is taken from the This Town Needs Guns song \"It's Not True Rufus, Don't Listen To The Hat\".\n Lines Across Maps cite bands such as Jocasta Sleeps, Reuben, Oceansize, Biffy Clyro, Twin Atlantic, Blakfish and Meet Me In St Louis as major influences.\nRiverbeds (band)\nRiverbeds is a Canadian post-rock\/emo band from Montreal, Qc formed in 2010.\n The band made its recording debut in 2012 with the EP \"Hiding Small Things In Obvious Places\" which was released on November 24 at Panda Bar.\n Riverbeds musical style has been described by Indecent Xposure as being influenced by \"Thrice, The Almost and Circa Survive amongst others\".\n The band shared the stage with both local and international bands, including Daylight (now Superheaven), Tyler Daniel Bean and Stuck On Planet Earth.\nThe Works Recording Studio\nThe Works Recording Studio was a recording studio located in Stockport, Greater Manchester, UK between 1998 and 2007.\n Built in a Victorian rectory it was originally an analogue studio used by unsigned bands and fading stars of Manchester's rich musical scene including ex-members of The Smiths and The Stone Roses.\n In 2001 it installed a Pro Tools system, and then recorded albums for bands such as Amplifier, Oceansize, Inertia Blooms and Performance.\n In 2005 there was a bizarre 3 a.m. appearance by U.S. rap star Snoop Dogg who visited the studio after playing a concert, bringing an entourage of musicians, enormous bodyguards and a chef.\n The studio also branched out into making music videos.\n In 2007 \"Super Producer\" Timbaland used the studio whilst on tour with Justin Timberlake.\nMorbid Angel\nMorbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida formed in 1983 by guitarist and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, original vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and original drummer Mike Browning.\n Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, atonality in guitar playing, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere.\n They have been described as one of \"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\", alongside Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands.\n They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \"God of Emptiness\" shown on an episode of \"Beavis and Butt-head\".\n Their first four albums are considered classics in the genre.\nSuperheaven\nSuperheaven (formerly known as Daylight) is an American alternative rock band from Doylestown, Pennsylvania, formed in 2008.\n Their music has been described as reminiscent of 1990s grunge and shoegazing, but Taylor Madison has expressed a dislike for such labels, describing it simply as rock\/rock and roll.\nOceansize\nOceansize were an English rock band from Manchester, formed in 1998.\n The band consisted of Mike Vennart (vocals, guitar), Steve Durose (guitar, backing vocals), Richard \"Gambler\" Ingram (guitar, keyboards), Mark Heron (drums) and Jon Ellis (bass guitar) for the majority of its career, with Steve Hodson replacing Ellis on bass guitar in 2006.\nCeltic metal\nCeltic metal is a subgenre of folk metal that developed in the 1990s in Ireland.\n As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal and Celtic rock.\n The early pioneers of the genre were the Irish bands Cruachan, Primordial and Waylander.\n The genre has since expanded beyond Irish shores and is known to be performed today by bands from numerous other countries.\nStoner rock\nStoner rock or stoner metal is a rock music fusion genre that combines elements of heavy metal and\/or doom metal with psychedelic rock and acid rock.\n The name references cannabis consumption.\n The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \"stoner rock\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \"desert rock\".\n Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \"retro\" production.\n The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep.\n","problem":"Superheaven and Oceansize, are bands of which shared genre?","answer":"rock"}
{"context":"Heroes in the Wind\nHeroes in the Wind: From Kull to Conan; the Best of Robert E. Howard is a 2009 collection of dark fantasy and horror short stories written by Robert E. Howard, selected and with an introduction by John Clute.\n Most of the stories were originally published in various fantasy magazines and feature Howard's heroes Kull, Bran Mak Morn and Conan, among others.\n It was first published in paperback in September 2009 by Penguin Books in its Penguin Modern Classics series.\nConan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of\nRobert E. Howard's Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, or simply Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, is a sword and sorcery British pen-and-paper role-playing game set in the world of Conan the Barbarian, the fictional Hyborian Age.\n Both the character and the setting were first imagined by American author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) as of 1932 and until his suicide in 1936.\n Howard's original literary work has since spawned a vast franchise of novels, comic books, films, video games, board games, role-playing games, etc.\n Following this tradition, \"Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of\" is the third officially licensed Conan role-playing game.\n The two precedent games were \"Conan Role-Playing Game\" (1985-1988) and \"\" (2004-2010), although there also had been supplements for independent generic systems, like \"GURPS Conan\" (1988-1989).\nValeria (Conan the Barbarian)\nValeria is a pirate and adventuress (a member of \"The Red Brotherhood\" of pirates) in the fictional universe of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories.\n She appears in Robert E. Howard's Conan novella \"Red Nails\", serialized in \"Weird Tales\" 28 1-3 (July, August\/September & October 1936).\n This was the last Conan story written by Howard, and published posthumously.\n The name was also used for Conan's love interest in the 1982 film \"Conan the Barbarian\".\nOptometry\nOptometry is a health care profession which involves examining the eyes and applicable visual systems for defects or abnormalities as well as the medical diagnosis and management of eye disease.\n Traditionally, the field of optometry began with the primary focus of correcting refractive error through the use of spectacles.\n Modern day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the education curriculum additionally includes intensive medical training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease in countries where the profession is established and regulated.\n Optometrists (also known as Doctors of Optometry in the US and Canada for those holding the O.D. degree or Ophthalmic Opticians in the UK) are medical professionals who provide primary eyecare through comprehensive eye examinations to detect and treat various visual abnormalities and eye diseases.\n Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location.\n Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to ophthalmologists who are physicians that specialize in tertiary medical and surgical care of the eye.\n Optometrists typically work closely together with other eye care professionals such as ophthalmologists and opticians to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public.\nLee Family Digital Archive\nThe Lee Family Digital Archive is a scholarly effort to collect, edit, and disseminate the papers of the Lee family of Virginia.\n The Lees of Virginia included Richard Lee I, the immigrant founder of the family, who came to Virginia from England around 1640, and his descendants.\n Some of the most famous Lees are Thomas Lee, the President of Virginia; Richard Henry Lee and Francis Lightfoot Lee, signers of the Declaration of Independence; Arthur Lee, the Penman of the Revolution; Light-Horse Harry Lee, the cavalry hero of the Continental army, three-time governor of Virginia, and the father of Robert E. Lee; Thomas Sim Lee, Revolutionary governor of Maryland; Richard Bland Lee, U.S. Senator; Charles Lee, U.S. Supreme Court justice; Richard Bland Lee II, a noted explorer; Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who is by far the most famous of the family; William Henry Fitzhugh (Rooney) Lee, the son of Robert E. Lee and a U.S. Congressman from Virginia; and Fitzhugh Lee, Governor of Virginia and Civil War cavalry general.\n President Zachary Taylor was a Lee descendant, on his mother's side.\nRichard Ford\nRichard Ford (born February 16, 1944) is an American novelist and short story writer.\n His best-known works are the novel \"The Sportswriter\" and its sequels, \"Independence Day\", \"The Lay of the Land\" and \"Let Me Be Frank With You\", and the short story collection \"Rock Springs\", which contains several widely anthologized stories.\nLegacy of Robert E. Howard\nRobert E. Howard's legacy extended after his death in 1936.\n Howard's most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, has a pop-culture imprint that has been compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond.\n Howard's critical reputation suffered at first but over the decades works of Howard scholarship have been published.\n The first professionally published example of this was L. Sprague de Camp's \"Dark Valley Destiny\" (1983) which was followed by other works, including Don Herron's \"The Dark Barbarian\" (1984) and Mark Finn's \"\" (2006).\n Also in 2006, a charity, Robert E. Howard Foundation, was created to promote further scholarship.\nRobert E. Howard\nRobert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 \u2013 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres.\n He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre.\nRed Sonja (film)\nRed Sonja is a 1985 Dutch-American sword and sorcery action film directed by Richard Fleischer.\n The film introduces Brigitte Nielsen as the title character with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, Ronald Lacey, Ernie Reyes, Jr., Paul L. Smith and Pat Roach in supporting roles.\n The film features the sword-wielding Marvel Comics character Red Sonja, created by Roy Thomas, who first appeared in Marvel's \"Conan the Barbarian\" series (#23) in 1973.\n The film's character of Red Sonja was based on Red Sonya of Rogatino, a character created by Robert E. Howard appearing in his short story \"The Shadow of the Vulture\" (1934).\n The film acknowledges that it was \"based on the character created by Robert E. Howard\" in the introductory credits.\nNational Association for Chiropractic Medicine\nThe National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) was a minority chiropractic association founded in 1984 that described itself as a \"consumer advocacy association of chiropractors\".\n It openly rejected some of the more controversial aspects of chiropractic, including a basic concept of chiropractic, vertebral subluxations as the cause of all diseases.\n It also sought to \"reform the chiropractic profession away from a philosophical scope of practice and towards an applied science scope of practice.\"\n It stated that it was \"dedicated to bringing the scientific based practice of chiropractic into mainstream medicine\" and that its members \"confine their scope of practice to scientific parameters and seek to make legitimate the utilization of professional manipulative procedures in mainstream health care delivery.\"\n \"While the NACM is focused on furthering the profession, its primary focus is on the rights and safety of the consumers.\"\n The NACM was the object of much controversy and criticism from the rest of the profession.\n It quietly dropped out of sight and its demise apparently occurred sometime between May 30, 2008 and March 6, 2010.\n","problem":"Who has more scope of profession, Richard Ford or Robert E.

The type species is \"S. syrticus\" of late Miocene Africa, which reached roughly 4 m (13.1 ft) in shoulder height.\n The other unequivocally recognized species is \"S. orbus\", also of late Miocene Africa.\n Other species outside of Africa are questionably placed in this genus, including teeth from Late Miocene Hungary and Iran originally described as being of the \"Mastodon\" subgenus \"Bunolophodon\", Chinese specimens originally described as being also of \"Mastodon\", as well as of \"Tetralophodon\" and \"Stegodon\", and a species from the late Miocene-aged Dokh Pathan Formation in Pakistan, \"S. maluvalensis\".\nVolvopluteus michiganensis\nVolvopluteus michiganensis is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae.\n It was originally described under the name \"Pluteus michiganensis\" but molecular studies have placed it in the \"Volvopluteus\", a genus described in 2011.\n The cap of this mushroom is about 7 \u2013 in diameter, gray, and has a cracked margin that is sticky when fresh.\n The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink.\n The stipe is white and has a volva at the base.\n Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species.\n \"V.\u00a0michiganensis\" is a saprotrophic fungus that was originally described as growing on sawdust.\n It has only been reported from Michigan (USA) and the Dominican Republic.\nJurodidae\nThe beetle family Jurodidae was originally described from fossils, but in 1996, a single species from the Russian Far East, described as Sikhotealinia zhiltzovae, was found and later was recognized to be a living representative of this otherwise extinct family (a \"living fossil\").\n Since then, this beetle, known from only a single specimen, has been the source of contention, as it is reported to possess three ocelli on its forehead, a condition otherwise unknown in the entire order Coleoptera, whether extinct or living - though it is common in other orders, and generally considered a groundplan character for neopteran insects.\n If true, this species may represent the most archaic of all living beetles.\n However, other authorities have challenged this interpretation, and have further suggested that this beetle does not even belong to the Archostemata.\n This may not be possible to resolve until additional specimens are collected, allowing for genetic analysis.\nAgonum fuliginosum\nAgonum fuliginosum is a species of ground beetle in the Platyninae family.\n It was described by Panzer in 1809 and can be found everywhere in

moose [known in Europe as European elk] dung.\n In 2013, the fungus named after \"Alces alces\" was transferred by Redhead et al. to \"Protostropharia\", a genus circumscribed to contain \"Stropharia\" species characterized by the formation of astrocystidia rather than acanthocytes on their mycelium.\n In addition to Europe, the species has also been recorded in Brazil.\n The variety \"austrobrasiliensis\" was described from Rio Grande do Sul in 2008, where it grows on cow dung, or dung-enriched soil.\nCicindela albissima\nCicindela albissima, commonly called the Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle is a species of tiger beetle endemic to Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in southern Utah, United States.\n It was originally described by Rumpp in 1962 as the subspecies \"Cicindela limbata albissima\", but mitochondrial DNA, along with the species' morphological and geographical distinctiveness, have shown that it is a separate species.\n \"C. albissima\" can be distinguished from other \"Cicindela\" species by its restricted range and lack of pigmentation on its elytra.\nBark beetle\nA bark beetle is one of about 220 genera with 6,000 species of beetles in the subfamily Scolytinae.\n Traditionally, this was considered a distinct family Scolytidae, but is now understood to be very specialized members of the \"true weevil\" family (Curculionidae).\n Well-known species are members of the type genus \"Scolytus\", namely the European elm bark beetle \"S. multistriatus\" and the large elm bark beetle \"S. scolytus\", which like the American elm bark beetle \"Hylurgopinus rufipes\", transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (\"Ophiostoma\").\n The mountain pine beetle \"Dendroctonus ponderosae\", southern pine beetle \"Dendroctonus frontalis\", and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America.\n A similarly aggressive species in Europe is the spruce ips \"Ips typographus\".\n A tiny bark beetle, the coffee berry borer, \"Hypothenemus hampei\" is a major pest on coffee plantations around the world.\nScydosella\nScydosella is a genus of beetles that consists of only one species Scydosella musawasensis.\n The species is regarded as the smallest free-living insect, as well as the smallest beetle.\n They are among featherwing beetle, named because of their feather-like spiny wings.\n It was first discovered in Nicaragua, and described in 1999 by Wesley Eugene Hall of the University of Nebraska State Museum.\n The initial discovery consisted of very few specimens, and exact measurements were not conclusive.\n Because of their tiny size, they were difficult to observe under microscope after preservation.\n The generally accepted size was 0.300\u00a0mm in length.\n On 8 February 2015, Alexey Polilov of the Lomonosov Moscow State University collected 85 specimens in Chicaque National Park, Colombia.\n They were discovered on a layer of fungus on which they feed.\n From these specimens exact measurements could be made, and was found that the smallest individual is only 0.325\u00a0mm long.\n The largest individual is 0.352\u00a0mm long, and the average length of all the specimens is

{"context":"Clerodendrum infortunatum\nClerodendrum infortunatum, the hill glory bower, is a perennial shrub belonging to the family Lamiaceae, also sometimes classified under Verbenaceae.\n It is the type species among ~400 species of \"Clerodendrum\".\n It is one of the most well-known natural health remedies in traditional practices and siddha medicine.\nLourensford Alluvium Fynbos\nLourensford Alluvium Fynbos is a critically endangered vegetation type that is endemic to Cape Town.\n Though closest to Fynbos, it has characteristics of both Fynbos and Renosterveld vegetation and is thus actually a unique hybrid vegetation type.\nVegetation and slope stability\nVegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.\n The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.\n Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.\n There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.\nDesert riparian\nDesert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.\n It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.\n The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.\n The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.\n Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.\n Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\").\n Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.\n Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.\nFothergilla gardenii\nFothergilla gardenii, also known by the common names Witch Alder, dwarf fothergilla, American wych hazel, and dwarf witchalder is a deciduous shrub in the Hamamelidaceae family.\n It is one of two species in the genus \"Fothergilla.\"\nVegetation classification\nVegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.\n Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.\n Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.\n In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.\n Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.\n Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.\nClerodendrum\nClerodendrum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae.\n Its common names include glorybower, bagflower and bleeding-heart.\n It is currently classified in the subfamily Ajugoideae, being one of several genera transferred from Verbenaceae to Lamiaceae in the 1990s, based on phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular data.\nWildfire\nA wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.\n Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.\n Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.\n Wildfire\u2019s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.\n Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.\nCaatinga\nCaatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy).\n It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an

{"context":"Doroban\u021bu, Tulcea\nDoroban\u021bu is a commune in Tulcea County, Romania.\n It is composed of five villages: Ardealu (depopulated as of 2002, historical name: \"As\u00eenlar\"), C\u00e2rjelari, Doroban\u021bu, F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Oilor (historical name: \"Coiumbunar\" or \"Coiumpunar\") and Me\u0219teru (historical name:\"Canat Calfa\").\nIodic acid\nIodic acid, HIO, can be obtained as a white or off-white solid.\n It dissolves in water very well, but it also exists in the pure state, as opposed to chloric acid or bromic acid.\n Iodic acid contains iodine in the oxidation state +5 and it is one of the most stable oxo-acids of the halogens in its pure state.\n When iodic acid is carefully heated, it dehydrates to iodine pentoxide.\n On subsequent heating, the iodine pentoxide further decomposes, giving a mix of iodine, oxygen and lower oxides of iodine.\nYulin, Guangxi\nYulin (), formerly romanized as Watlam, is one of the fourteen prefecture-level cities of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China.\n Its Chinese name was changed in 1956 from the historical name \u9b31\u6797 (), which only sounds the same in Mandarin as the current one, but very different in the local dialect of Yue Chinese; \u9b31 is uat\u02e5 while \u7389 is \u0235ok\u02e8.\n The former romanization follows the pronunciation of the historical name in Yue Chinese.\nCasimcea\nCasimcea is a commune in Tulcea County, Romania.\n It is composed of seven villages: Casimcea, Ci\u0219meaua Nou\u0103 (historical name: \"Ramazanchioi\"), Corugea, Haidar, Rahman and R\u0103zboieni (historical name: \"Alifac\u00e2\").\nSulfuric acid\nSulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g\/mol.\n It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations.\n Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards.\n The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.\nPhenazine\nPhenazine is an organic compound with the formula (CH)N.\n It is a dibenzo annulated pyrazine, and the parent substance of many dyestuffs, such as the toluylene red, indulines, and safranines (and the closely related eurhodines).\n Phenazine crystallizes in yellow needles, which are only sparingly soluble in alcohol.\n Sulfuric acid dissolves it, forming a deep-red solution.\nAscorbic acid (molecular aspects)\nAscorbic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound with antioxidant properties.\n It is a white solid, but impure samples can appear yellowish.\n It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions.\n Ascorbic acid is one form (\"vitamer\") of vitamin C.\n It was originally called -hexuronic acid, but, when it was found to have vitamin C activity in animals (\"vitamin C\" being defined as a vitamin activity, not then a specific substance), the suggestion was made to rename it.\n The new name, ascorbic acid, is derived from \"a-\" (meaning \"no\") and \"scorbutus\" (scurvy), the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Because it is derived from glucose, many animals are able to produce it, but humans require it as part of their nutrition.\n Other vertebrates which lack the ability to produce ascorbic acid include some primates, guinea pigs, teleost fishes, bats, and some birds, all of which require it as a dietary micronutrient (that is, in vitamin form).\nAcid strength\nThe strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton (H).\n A strong acid is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent).\n In water, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves yielding one mole of H (as hydronium ion HO) and one mole of the conjugate base, A. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains.\n Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO), nitric acid (HNO) and sulfuric acid (HSO).\n In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%.\nBouin solution\nBouin solution is a compound fixative used in histology.\n It is composed of picric acid, acetic acid and formaldehyde in an aqueous solution.\n It is especially good for gastrointestinal tract biopsies because this fixative allows crisper and better nuclear staining than 10% neutral-buffered formalin.\n It is not a good fixative when tissue ultrastructure must be preserved for electron microscopy.\n However, it is a good fixative when tissue structure with a soft and delicate texture must be preserved.\n Formalin-fixed tissue is normally mordanted with Bouin solution for better staining results in the trichrome stains.\n The acetic acid in this fixative lyses red blood cells and dissolves small iron and calcium deposits in tissue.\n A variant in which the acetic acid is replaced with formic acid can be used for both fixation of tissue and decalcification.\nBoric acid\nBoric acid, also called hydrogen borate, boracic acid, orthoboric acid and acidum boricum , is a weak, monobasic Lewis acid of boron, which is often used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other chemical compounds.\n It has the chemical formula HBO (sometimes written B(OH)), and exists in the form of colorless crystals or a white powder that dissolves in water.\n When occurring as a mineral, it is called sassolite.\n","problem":"What is the historical name of the acid that dissolves phenazine?","answer":"oil of vitriol"}

Constitution of 2012\nThe Constitution of the Arab Republic of Egypt was the former fundamental law of Egypt.\n It was signed into law by President Mohamed Morsi on 26 December 2012, after it was approved by the Constituent Assembly on 30 November 2012 and passed in a referendum held 15\u201322 December 2012 with 64% support, and a turnout of 33%.\n It replaced the 2011 Provisional Constitution of Egypt, adopted in 2011 following the Egyptian revolution.\n On 3 July 2013, the constitution was suspended by order of the Egyptian army.\n On 8 July 2013, acting President Adly Mansour issued a decree that envisaged the introduction of amendments to the constitution and put them to a referendum; if approved, the suspended-constitution would be restored into law.\n The current constitutional declaration has the power of a constitution; it outlines the authorities of the president and establishes many rights.\nHamayouni Decree\nThe Hamayoni Decree (also \"Hamayonic\", \"Hamayouni\") (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0627\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0649\u200e \u200e ) or \"Hamayony Khat\" is a clause in the Egyptian law that dates back to the Hatt-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun of February 1856 issued during Ottoman rule, which regulates Christian church construction and maintenance.\n It is currently a cause of much controversy due to the conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for the permit to be granted.\n These same restrictions do not apply to mosques.\n The law formerly required that each permit must be issued by the President of Egypt.\n In 1998, under the administration of Hosni Mubarak, the law was changed to also allow Egyptian Governors to grant permits.\nImperial Firman of 27 May 1866\nThe Imperial Firman Relative to Hereditary Succession was a \"firman\" (i.e., decree) issued by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abd\u00fclaziz on 27 May 1866 at the request of Isma'il Pasha, the \"w\u0101li\" (i.e. governor) of Egypt, which was then an Ottoman province.\n The \"firman\" changed the rule of succession in Egypt from one based on agnatic seniority to one based on male primogeniture in the direct line of Isma'il Pasha.\n The full text of the \"firman\" read as follows:\nKing of Egypt\nKing of Egypt (Arabic: \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0635\u0631\u200e \u200e \"Malik Mi\u1e63r \") was the title used by the ruler of Egypt between 1922 and 1951.\n When the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Egypt on 28 February 1922, Egypt's Sultan Fouad I issued a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of \"King of Egypt\".\n It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt's newly independent status, but also to Fouad I's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq.\n The only other monarch to be styled \"King of Egypt\" was Fouad I's son Alex Sofroniou who was previously named king gret Farouk I, whose title was changed to \"King of Egypt and the Sudan\" in October 1951 following the Wafdist government's unilateral abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.\n The monarchy was abolished on 18 June 1953 following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the establishment of a republic.\n The then-king, the infant Fuad II of Egypt (Farouk having abdicated following the revolution), went into exile in Switzerland.\nAnti-Coup Alliance\nThe Anti-Coup Alliance (also known as the National Alliance Supporting Legitimacy) is a coalition in Egypt formed to defeat the ouster of former president Mohamed Morsi.\n The coalition is made up of approximately 40 Islamist parties and groups.\n The coalition has called upon the opposition to break ties with figures they call \"corrupt\" from the Mubarak regime.\n Notably, the political wing of the group (the Building and Development Party) and the Wasat Party did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013.\n The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Homeland Party are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the Virtue Party, Authenticity Party and the Muslim Brotherhood are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president.\n The group has reached out to what it called \"fellow revolutionaries\" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; Kefaya objected to the call for cooperation.\n Members of the Building and Development Party, the political arm of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, wanted to meet with Yasser Al Borhamy, the deputy head of the Salafist Call as well as Emad Abdel Ghaffour, who is the head of the Homeland Party.\n Al Borhamy reportedly could not meet with the members, while Ghaffour asked them to stop demonstrations before talks could begin and rebuffed their demands for the reinstatement of Morsi and the bringing back of the Shura Council that was dissolved.\n Borhami denied being asked to serve as a mediator, though he stated that he would act as a mediator if there were no preconditions.\n The alliance has said it will boycott the 2014 constitutional referendum.\n Various groups and parties within the alliance including al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Building and Development Party, the Islamic Party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Virtue Party have criticized the Nour Party for its support of the draft constitution.\n The Islamic Party has not participated in meetings with the group because of what Mohamed Abu Samra (the secretary-general of the party) called the \"brotherhood's radical thought\".\n The Salafist Front issued a statement on 30 April 2014 that called on the alliance to temporarily stop its actions in order to avoid more violence; the alliance did not suspend its activities in response.\n Egyptian Prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree on 16 October 2014 banning the alliance.\n Another decree was issued on 30 October 2014 which dissolved the alliance.\n A court postponed the appeal of the dissolution of the alliance until 13 November 2014.\nDecree 1775\nDecree 1775 was signed into Brazilian law by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on January 8, 1996.\n The decree changed the steps FUNAI was required to follow to demarcate indigenous lands, effectively making the process more complicated and allowing for more interference from commercial interests.\n Individuals or companies were allowed from the beginning of the demarcation process until 90 days after FUNAI issued their report to submit an appeal showing that the contested lands do not meet the qualifications of indigenous lands as stated in the constitution.\n The decree also placed the final decision in the hands of the Minister of Justice, which left the fate of indigenous lands vulnerable to various political ideologies.\n The government claimed that allowing people to contest indigenous lands during the demarcation process would prevent any future challenges of completed lands on the basis of unconstitutionality.\n The decree was widely contested as a violation of indigenous rights, earning the nickname of the \"Genocide Decree,\" due to the power it gave to commercial interests to exploit Indian lands.\n By April 1996, FUNAI had received over 500 appeals for over 40 indigenous territories that were in the process of being demarcated.\n FUNAI followed procedure and submitted its official opinion to the Ministry of Justice, rejecting the appeals that were brought against the indigenous lands.\n Justice Nelson Jobim sided with FUNAI on all except eight territories, ordering further investigation.\nKal Naga\nKal Naga (also credited as Khaled Naga or Khaled Abol Naga) is a multi award-winning actor, film producer and director from Egypt (he directed theatre mostly and short films).\n He is a movie star in the Arab World and the Middle East but also a familiar face internationally specially in European film festivals, where he has been honoured with a diverse range of awards as an actor and producer as well as a jury member in film festivals.\n Since 2016 he focused on English speaking markets [\"Tyrant\" TV series season 3 (2016), American FX TV Network, \"Vikings\" season 5 (2017), History Channel and \"The Last Post\" TV mini series, UK's BBC TV].\n His roles covered a multitude of genres, from musicals [\"None but that!\"\n (2007)], action

(Sleeping Habibi)\" (2008)].\n He played the lead in many award-winning films that gained him outstanding international critics acclaim as one of the finest actors in the world today out of the Arab region.\n He studied and graduated (with highest honours) as a Tele-communication engineer' from Ain Shams University, studied theatre (as a minor) at the American University in Cairo, and worked on a spacecraft design program (UoSAT-5 ) in the UK.\n He finally confirmed his passion and calling for the arts by the year 2000.\n In a film festival in 2016 celebrating Arabic films submissions to the \"Oscars,\" he was honoured for being the most submitted actor in Arabic films submissions to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"The Oscars)\".\n He is often tagged in western media as \"Egypt's \"Brad Pitt\" for his many career similarities with the latter, also described as \"the next Omar Sharif\" specially after his American debut movie \"Civic Duty\" in 2007.\n He was also described as \"Egypt's International treasure\" for advocating for freedom and standing up against injustice in his home country Egypt.\n He is one of the most recognisable faces of the 2011 revolution, seizing the anti-regime sentiment in the streets of Cairo and taking part in mass demonstrations that led to the removal of President Mubarak.\n He faced defamation campaigns against him by the state owned and controlled media during Mubarak era before the January 25th 2011 revolution in Egypt, and once again from the 2013 \"coup d'etat\" General Sisi government in Egypt.\n Nonetheless he continued his regional and international award-winning success, as well as waves of strong support on social media.\n He also had a very celebrated and successful career across the Arab world TV networks as a TV & radio host in prime time shows from 1997 till 2005.\n He is a human and child rights activist and has been Egypt's UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador 2007\u20132015.\n He has worked across a diverse variety of media, including theatre, radio, television and film in Arabic, English and some French and Italian.\nEgypt\u2013Turkey relations\nEgyptian\u2013Turkish relations are bilateral relations between Egypt and Turkey.\n Egypt and Turkey are bound by strong religious, cultural and historical ties, but diplomatic ties between the two have remained extremely friendly at times and extremely strained at others.\n For three centuries, Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire, whose capital was Constantinople in modern-day Turkey.\n Turkey established diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1925 at the level of Charge d\u2019 Affaires and upgraded its mission in Cairo to Ambassadorial level in 1948.\n Both countries have embassies and consulate generals in the other's capitals.\n Both countries have signed a free trade agreement in December 2005.\n Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean.\n A natural gas deal between Egypt and Turkey\u2014the largest joint Egyptian-Turkish project to date, estimated to cost $4 billion\u2014is being implemented.\n On 16 April 2008, Egypt and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding to improve and further military relations and cooperation between the two countries.\n Relations however have been quite tense on many occasions in history of both countries including the Nasser era in Egypt in the 1950s and 60s.\n It has also strongly deteriorated in the period following the overthrow of the Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi on July 3, 2013 following a 48-hour deadline on July 1, marking the end of anti-government protests that took place between June 30 and July 3 that year.\nTen Conditions of Al-Ezabi\nThe legal foundation for the Egyptian state\u2019s control of church property was the Ottoman Hamayouni Decree of 1856.\n This decree sought to eliminate discrimination between citizens of different ethnicities and religions.\n Amongst other things, it gave Christians the right to construct places of worship by requiring them to submit a request to the Sultan.\n","problem":"The President of Egypt that changed the Hamayouni Decree was born in what

phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard.\n These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell.\n Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the spindle hole to add weight and stability.\n These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and from many of the old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose.\nAl-Ca composite\nAl-Ca composite is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite consisting of sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix.\n The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor.\n It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed.\n Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission.\n Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type.\n This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors.\n This eliminates the \"bird caging\", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands.\n The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys.\n The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines.\n Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs.\n The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind\/ice loading situations.\n The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses.\nMaximum

popular songs for Perry Como, Fred Waring and Ray Eberle; music for the \"Alaskan Stampede,\" a Leo Seltzer produced \"musical extravaganza on ice\" c. 1944, and an opera based on Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.\n He is best known for composing Symphony No. 1, known as the Alaskan Symphony, at Gypsy Trail, Carmel, New York in 1945.\n The work includes text from the \"Spell of the Yukon\" by Robert W. Service sung by a baritone soloist in the third movement, as well as other thematic inspirations drawn from his study of the climate, topography and history of the then-territory.\n The Alaskan Symphony was first performed in December 1945 by the American Symphony Orchestra and was broadcast across the United States and to overseas armed services at that time.\n Wilson Sawyer conducted the piece and Gov. Ernest Gruening of Alaska was guest speaker on the program.\n At Gruening's request, the original score was placed in the Alaskan Museum of Natural History [Alaska Historical Library and Museum] in Juneau, Alaska.\n In 1960, Sawyer's wife Maxine was diagnosed with spinal cancer and they moved to Pawling, New York where he operated a chicken farm and laundromat.\n He continued to compose.\n The Alaskan Symphony was performed by the Hudson Valley Philharmonic in 1975 with Sawyer again conducting even though he had recently suffered a stroke.\n Sawyer revised the Symphony in 1977, making substantial cuts to the fourth movement among other edits.\n The revised Alaskan Symphony was premiered by the Juneau Symphony on June 14, 2008, conducted by music director Kyle Wiley Pickett.\nSolidarity Forever\n\"Solidarity Forever\", written by Ralph Chaplin in 1915, is perhaps the most famous union anthem.\n It is sung to the tune of \"John Brown's Body\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\n Although it was written as a song for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), other union movements, such as the AFL-CIO, have adopted the song as their own.\n The song has been performed by musicians such as Utah Phillips, Pete Seeger, and was redone by Emcee Lynx and The Nightwatchman.\n It is still commonly sung at union meetings and rallies in the United States, Australia and Canada, and has also been sung at conferences of the Australian Labor Party and the Canadian New Democratic Party.\n This may have also inspired the hymn of the consumer cooperative movement, \"The Battle Hymn of Cooperation\", which is sung to the same tune.\nW. de Wycombe\nW. de Wycombe (Wicumbe, and perhaps Whichbury) (late thirteenth century) was an English composer and copyist of the Medieval era.\n He was precentor of the priory of Leominster in Herefordshire.\n It is possible that he was the composer of the most famous tune from medieval England, \"Sumer is icumen in\".\n","problem":"Who wrote the song that was sung to the famous tune of the composer known as the Father of the Symphony?","answer":"Ottokar Kernstock"}

for family entertainment.\n It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries.\n Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale.\n It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.\nNew York City\nThe City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.\n With an estimated 2016 population of 8,537,673 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 sqmi , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.\n Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.\n A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media and entertainment, art, fashion, research, technology, education, politics, and sports, its fast pace defining the term \"New York minute\".\n Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world.\nRevolt of the Beavers\nRevolt of the Beavers was a children's play put on by the Federal Theater Project by Oscar Saul and Louis Lantz.\n One critic described the play as \"Marxism a la Mother Goose\".\n The show ran at the Adelphi Theatre in New York City from

Theatre.)\n It received critical acclaim and won the award for Best New Play at the Critics Awards for Theatre in Scotland, 2007.\n Keith McIntyre's cartoon-like design was nominated for an award at the same time.\n The production was remounted in 2008, and toured the country again before taking part in the Brits-off-Broadway Season in New York City followed by Trap Door Theatre's production in Chicago.\nFair Play for Cuba Committee\nThe Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) was an activist group set up in New York City in April 1960.\n The FPCC's purpose was to provide grassroots support for the Cuban Revolution against attacks by the United States government, once Fidel Castro began openly admitting his commitment to Marxism and began the expropriation and nationalization of Cuban assets belonging to U.S. corporations.\n The FPCC opposed the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, the imposition of the United States embargo against Cuba, and was sympathetic to the Cuban view during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.\nAylesbury Waterside Theatre\nAylesbury Waterside Theatre is a \u00a347 million theatre in Aylesbury, England, United Kingdom presenting a range of West End and touring musicals and plays, along with performances of opera and ballet and a Christmas pantomime.\nMother Goose\nThe figure of Mother Goose is the imaginary author of a collection of fairy tales and nursery rhymes often published as \"Old Mother Goose's Rhymes\", as illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1913.\n As a character, she appears in one nursery rhyme.\n A Christmas pantomime called \"Mother Goose\" is often performed in the United Kingdom.\n The so-called \"Mother Goose\" rhymes and stories have formed the basis for many classic British pantomimes.\n Mother Goose is generally depicted in literature and book illustration as an elderly country woman in a tall hat and shawl, a costume identical to the peasant costume worn in Wales in the early 20th century, but is sometimes depicted as a goose (usually wearing a bonnet).\nCombination company\nA combination company was a theatrical touring company which performed only one play.\n Unlike repertory companies, which performed multiple plays in rotation, combination companies used more elaborate and specialized scenery in their productions.\n Repertory theatre had been popular in the United States through the 19th century, and it is not clear how the combination system originated.\n Combination companies contributed to the early success of Broadway theatre, as most combination companies began their tours in New York City.\n Combination companies were fueled by stars.\n The Star agenda or star system that had been set in place in mid 19th century America helped greatly in the development of the combination company.\n The idea of celebrity was at full force and people would flock to theater houses to see their favorite stars perform.\n Stars made famous in New York would travel to stock theaters and perform limited engagements there.\n \u201cThe engagements of the first important stars\u2026 were rare and special events\u201d(Poggi 4).\n Audiences would come in from all over to sold out performances at playhouses and see their favorite stars.\n The Stock companies would cancel their normal repertory programs for a few nights to allow for the show of the star.\n The star would be supported by the local company of actors in the play, which proved to be very frustrating to them (Poggi 5).\n After the star left, the company returned to its repertory schedule as per usual.\n Yet annoyed by the lack of talent from regional companies, the stars began to search for companies to tour with them.\n They began to tour with two or three actors, and then eventually whole companies would tour with them and they would perform a repertory of plays (Wilmeth 200-201).\n This switch to companies that support the stars for the whole tour was one more step in the transition from stock companies to combination companies.\nSelkirk hurdle\nThe Selkirk Hurdle is the term used by urban planners, railroad employees, politicians, and others to describe the route that must be taken by freight trains traveling between New York City and other points in downstate New York that are east of the Hudson River, and locations in the United States to the south and west.\n There are no rail freight bridges or tunnels that cross the Hudson River south of Selkirk, which is 10 miles (16\u00a0km) south of Albany and the home of Selkirk Yard, a major CSX classification yard.\n As a result, trains from Long Island and New York City (except for the borough of Staten Island which has a rail bridge to New Jersey) must travel 140 mi north to cross at Selkirk before continuing on their way.\n Advocates claim that this detour and the inefficiencies that result force New York City to rely more heavily on relatively inefficient trucks than most parts of the United States, where freight trains are more common.\n However, at least for traffic to and from the west, this route was touted for its efficiency as the \"Water Level Route\" by the New York Central Railroad because trains using it did not have to climb over the Appalachian Mountains, and it is still used by the New York Central's successor, CSX, for traffic to both sides of the Hudson River.\n","problem":"In which theatre of New York

his father was Daniel Huger, a Continental Congressman and U.S. Representative from South Carolina.\n Daniel Elliott pursued classical studies in Charleston and graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1798.\n He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799, beginning practice in Charleston.\n In 1800 he married Isabella Johannes Middleton-daughter of Declaration of Independence signer Arthur Middleton.\n He was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1804 to 1819 and from 1830 to 1832, and was a brigadier general of State troops in 1814.\n He was judge of the circuit court from 1819 to 1830, and was a member of the South Carolina State Senate from 1838 to 1842.\n He was an opposition member of the State nullification convention in 1832.\nBenjamin Huger (American Revolution)\nBenjamin Huger (1746 \u2013 11 May 1779) was one of five Huger brothers from South Carolina who served in the American Revolutionary War.\n Huger became a close friend of La Fayette, having met him upon his arrival near Georgetown in 1777, and his son Francis Kinloch Huger had a role in getting La Fayette temporarily released from prison at Olomouc in the 1790s.\nGilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette\nMarie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (] ; 6 September 1757 \u2013 20 May 1834), in the United States often known simply as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War.\n A close friend of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson, Lafayette was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830.\nImplied powers\nImplied powers, in the United States, are those powers authorized by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem to be implied by powers expressly stated.\n When George Washington asked Alexander Hamilton to defend the constitutionality of the First Bank of the United States against the protests of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph, Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers.\n Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends.\n Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means which it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.\n Hamilton noted that the \"general welfare clause\" and the \"necessary and proper clause\" gave elasticity to the constitution.\n Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed his Bank Bill into law.\nAnti-Administration party\nThe \"Anti-Administration party\" (1789\u20131792) was an informal faction led by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson that opposed policies of then United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton in the first term (1789\u20131792) of President George Washington.\n This was not an organized political party, but an unorganized faction.\n Most had been Anti-Federalists in 1788, meaning they opposed ratification of the Constitution of the United States.\n However, the situation was fluid, with members moving in and out.\nFrancis Kinloch Huger\nColonel Dr. Francis Kinloch Huger (September 17, 1773 \u2013 February

Adams.\nAlexander Hamilton\nAlexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and \"The New York Post\" newspaper.\n As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.\n He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.\n His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.\n This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.\n They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.\n They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking.\nDemocratic-Republican Party\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was an American political party formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in 1791\u201393 to oppose the centralizing policies of the new Federalist Party run by Alexander Hamilton (1755\/57-1804), who was secretary of the treasury and chief architect of George Washington's administration.\n The new party controlled the presidency and Congress, as well as most states, from 1801 to 1825, during the First Party System.\n It began in 1791 as one faction in Congress, and included many politicians who had been opposed to the new constitution.\n They called themselves \"Republicans\" after their ideology, Republicanism.\n They distrusted the Federalist commitment to republicanism.\n The party splintered in 1824 into the Jacksonian movement (which became the Democratic Party in 1828) and the short-lived National Republican Party (later succeeded by the Whig Party).\nThomas Jefferson (Cleveland)\nThomas Jefferson is a bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson

{"context":"The Society of Floristry Limited\nThe Society of Floristry Limited was formed in 1951 to meet the growing need for professional recognition for florists. Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years.\n It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development.\n The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product.\n These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design.\n The cornerstone of the success of the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF).\n When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted.\n As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also.\n The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF.\n The courses came into existence during 2006 - see http:\/\/www.nptc.org.uk\/qualifications\/default.asp?area=130.\n This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more transparent and accessible.\n However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded.\n On 28.2.10 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association.\nWhistling in Dixie\nWhistling in Dixie is a 1942 crime comedy film, the second of three starring Red Skelton as murder mystery writer and amateur crime solver Wally Benton (aka.\n The Fox) and Ann Rutherford as his fiancee.\n The pair are called upon to solve a crime in the American South.\n The film also re-introduces Rags Ragland, playing dual roles as twins, the mostly-reformed Chester, as well as his villainous brother from the first film.\n The film turns into a romantic comedy mystery, complete with death traps, corrupt politicians and lost gold, ending with a frenetic fight at the end between Wally Benton and both of Rags Ragland's characters.\nMeet the People\nMeet the People (1944) is a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical comedy film made during World War II, and starring Lucille Ball and Dick Powell and featuring Virginia O'Brien, Bert Lahr, Rags Ragland

his City Slickers, and Virginia O'Brien were also in the original stage cast.\n O'Brien sings the hit song \"Say We're Sweethearts Again\".\nArne Skarpsno\nArne Skarpsno (May 7, 1926 \u2013 March 22,

and drug addicts.\n He and his wife Gerd would distribute packed lunches to the needy on the streets of Oslo.\n He was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in 1997 for his volunteer work.\n In 2007 a bust of him was introduced at the area informally known as \"Plata\" (\"The Platter\") in downtown Oslo, the city's center point for heroin and illegal drugs trade for several years.\n Skarpsno was present at the introduction and he urged the general population to do more for other people.\n Having taken a blood test in May 2006, it became clear that he had cancer, and he was admitted to the Akershus University Hospital in November the same year.\n There a kidney and a tumor were removed.\n He died at Akershus University Hospital.\nSleeman, Ontario\nSleeman is an unincorporated community located in Rainy River District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.\n The town site is located in the center of Dawson.\n The original town site was along the Rainy River some 3\u00a0km south but in the early 1900s when the steam ships that traveled from Fort Frances to Rainy River and then to Rat Portage Via Lake of the Woods carrying Logs, Lumber, mail and other supplies stopped probably because the Canadian Northern Railway had finished its bridge and rail line from Winnipeg to International Falls and the docks of the great lakes located in Fort William and Port Arthur now known as Thunder Bay the town moved from the river to the rail line.\n The original store, coffee shop, post office building still stands today and has been renovated into a home.\n The town for many years held many stores, a large hotel, coffee shops, car dealership, school and a busy rail depot that served the Northern communities along Highway 621.\n A restaurant called The Green Onion was the local favourite, it was open 7 days a week and held indoor livery stables below for the travels from Morson who came to town to meet the trains, liquor was served here as well.\n Today there is only one business left, the Canada Postal outlet.\n Lowes Lumber a local business for over 80 years went into bankruptcy and closed its doors in 2014.\n Only about 20 homes remain, even though an official town plan was made to accommodate many more.\n The rail siding was removed in 1993, the last of the CN hotel burned away in the late 1980s and the grocery store was demolished when the natural gas line was installed to serve the larger communities along Highway 11.\nCotton paper\nCotton paper, also known as rag paper, is made using cotton linters or cotton from used cloth (rags) as the primary material.\n Important documents are often printed on cotton paper, because it is known to last many years without deterioration.\n Cotton paper is superior in both strength and durability to wood pulp-based paper, which may contain high concentrations of acids, and also absorbs ink or toner better.\n Different grades of cotton paper can be produced.\nNiles Canyon ghost\nThe Niles Canyon ghost story is the Northern California variation on the vanishing hitchhiker archetype.\n There are many different variations of this story depending on whom you ask.\n All stories include a girl being involved in some sort of motorized vehicle accident on February 26 (year often changed).\n One variation of the story includes a girl being involved in a car crash on Niles Canyon road (off the 680 freeway in Sunol, California) on the way to her prom.\n The girl died on impact and to this day is said to haunt Niles Canyon road every February 26.\n The tale of the haunting goes that people traveling along Niles Canyon road (now Highway 84) on the night of February 26 will see a normal-looking high school-aged girl walking along the road in a prom dress (many people have said it is white).\n People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride.\n She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller).\n Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear.\n Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there.\n Today, many people will travel along this treacherous pitch black road in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Niles Canyon ghost.\nCamelford water pollution incident\nThe Camelford water pollution incident involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of Camelford, Cornwall, in July 1988.\n Twenty tonnes of aluminium sulphate was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level.\n As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of sulphuric acid which \"stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people\u2019s homes.\"\n Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects, and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear as of 2012 .\n There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event.\n Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain.\n Dame Barbara Clayton led a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution enquiry into the incident.\nCaledonian Curling Club\nThe Caledonian Curling Club (also known as the Callie Curling Club)

southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic until surpassed by Hurricane Felix of 2007.\n Edith developed from a tropical wave on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea.\n Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico.\n After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km\/h) on September 16.\n Edith steadily

hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, traversing through the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and East Coast of the United States during late August and early September.\n David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966.\n With winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km\/h), David was the only storm of Category\u00a05 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century and the deadliest since the 1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane, San Zenon, killing over 2,000\u00a0people in its path.\n The

5 hurricane, and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season.\n A tropical depression formed in the Caribbean Sea near Jamaica on October 15, headed westward, and two days later intensified into a tropical storm which turned abruptly southward and was named \"Wilma\".\n Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18.\n Shortly thereafter, explosive

as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall.\n The season was one of only six on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category\u00a05 hurricane.\n It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day.\n September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of

squally weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a03.\n Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward, and by September\u00a05, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla.\n About 24\u00a0hours later, Carla was upgraded to a hurricane.\n Shortly thereafter, the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucat\u00e1n Channel.\n Late on September\u00a07, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n By early on the following day, the storm became a major hurricane after reaching Category\u00a03 intensity.\n Resuming its northwestward course, Carla continued intensification and on September\u00a011, it was upgraded to a Category\u00a05 hurricane.\n Later that day, Carla weakened slightly, but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near Port O'Connor, Texas.\n It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September\u00a012.\n Heading generally northward, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a013, while centered over southern Oklahoma.\n Rapidly moving northeastward, Carla's

the World Food Programme in the Pakistani town of Khar, which is located within the Bajaur tribal region, of north-western Pakistan.\n It was later reported by witnesses, that the bomber dressed in a full-length burka had reportedly thrown a grenade after resisting search, to which then the bomber proceeded to detonate her explosives.\n Several police officials confirmed the bomber was a woman, as opposed to the more likely occurrence of a man wearing the burka as a disguise, in order to successfully conduct this suicide attack.\n It was also known that those in this crowd were predominantly displaced members of the Salarzai Tribe, which has supported Pakistan Army operations against the Pakistani Taliban within the Bajaur tribal regions.\n Those dozens of people injured in this suicide

Waziristan tribal region, in order to root-out and destroy the last major remaining safe-haven for Radical Islamist and Pakistani Taliban insurgents within the country.\n The U.N World Food Programme

{"context":"Colony of New Zealand\nThe Colony of New Zealand was a British colony that existed in New Zealand from 1841 to 1907.\n Originally created as a Crown colony, the power of the British government was vested in a governor.\n The colony was granted self-government in 1852; after the first parliament was elected in 1853, the 1852 Constitution was inaugurated.\n The first responsible government of New Zealand was formed in 1856.\n The Colony of New Zealand had three capitals: Old Russell (1841), Auckland (1841\u20131865) and Wellington (after 1865).\nUpper Canada Rebellion\nThe Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada (present day Ontario) in December 1837.\n While public grievances had existed for years, it was the rebellion in Lower Canada (present day Quebec) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after.\n The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) - mainly through the support of the Hunters' Lodges, a secret anti-British, US-based militia that emerged around the Great Lakes.\n They launched the Patriot War in 1838-39.\n The rebellion led directly to Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America and to \"The British North America Act, 1840\" which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system.\nProvince of Maryland\nThe Province of Maryland was an English and later British colony in North America that existed from 1632 until 1776, when it joined the other twelve of the Thirteen Colonies in rebellion against Great Britain and became the U.S. state of Maryland.\n Its first settlement and capital was St. Mary's City, in the southern end of St. Mary's County, which is a peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay and is also bordered by four tidal rivers.\nPhillip Calvert (governor)\nPhillip Calvert (1626 \u2013 1682), also known as Philip Calvert, was the fifth Governor of Maryland during a brief period in 1660 or 1661.\n He was appointed by the royally chartered proprietor of Maryland, Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637\u20131715), as a caretaker to replace Lt. Gen Josias Fendall (1628\u20131682), the fifth\/sixth?\n provincial governor.\nGeorgia Militia\nThe Georgia Militia existed from 1733 to 1879.\n It was originally planned by General James Oglethorpe prior to the founding of the Province of Georgia, the British colony that would become the U.S. state of Georgia.\n One reason for the founding of the colony was to act as a buffer between the Spanish settlements in Florida and the British colonies to the north.\n For background with respect to the region's Native Americans, see the Yamasee War (1715\u20131717) and Cherokee\u2013American wars (1776\u20131795).\nJohn Coggeshall Jr.\nJohn Coggeshall Jr. (c. 1624 - 1 October 1708) was a deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\n The son of Rhode Island President John Coggeshall Sr., he was raised in the village of Castle Hedingham in northeastern Essex where his father was a merchant.\n Aged about eight, he sailed from England with his parents and surviving siblings, arriving in New England in 1632.\n He was first active in civil affairs in 1653 when he became treasurer of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport.\n The following year brought the re-unification of the colony, with the island towns rejoining the government with Providence and Warwick, and he served as treasurer of the four towns for a year.\n His name appears on a list of Newport freemen in 1655, and for the following 35 years he served almost continuously in one or multiple roles including Assistant, General Treasurer, Deputy, General Recorder, and Major for the Island.\n He was one of ten Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries.\n In 1686 he became the Deputy Governor under Governor Walter Clarke, but his term lasted only a month when the English crown assigned Edmund Andros to be Governor of all the New England colonies under the Dominion of New England.\n Following the demise of this dominion and the arrest of Andros in 1689, Coggeshall was once again selected as Deputy Governor for the year ending in May 1690, serving under Governor Henry Bull.\n In April 1676, during King Philip's War, he was on a committee to procure boats for the colony's defense.\n Later that year, in August, he was a member of a court martial for the trial of several Indians.\n\u00c9tienne P\u00e9rier (governor)\n\u00c9tienne P\u00e9rier was the fifth governor of the Louisiana colony.\n He became governor in 1727.\n His governorship was marked by the arrival of the first Ursuline nuns in New Orleans in 1727 to establish the first convent within the limits of what was to become the United States as well as a war against the Natchez Indians due to bad relations with Chepart, the commander at Fort Rosalie.\n After agitating the Indians by demanding that they give up either their village or their land, the Indians launched an attack on November\u00a029, 1729, and killed nearly three hundred persons at Fort Rosalie.\n The French retaliated and by 1731 had killed or captured most of the Indians.\n The captured Indians were sent as slaves to Santo Domingo, and the few remaining free moved further westward and joined the Chickasaw Indians.\n This marked the end of the Natchez Indian nation.\n In the same year, the Company of the Indies petitioned the King of France to take back their charter, thus ending their control of the colony.\n P\u00e9rier remained governor for two years after Louisiana was returned to the Crown but became frustrated with deteriorating relations with the Chickasaws and lost interest in the colony.\n He resigned, and Jean-Baptiste le Moyne de Bienville was chosen to yet again serve as governor of the colony.\nMaryland in the American Revolution\nThen Province of Maryland had been a British colony since 1632, when George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore received a charter and grant from King Charles I of England and first created a haven for English Catholics in the New World, with his son, Cecil, equipping and sending over the first colonists to the Chesapeake Bay region.\n The first signs of rebellion against the mother country occurred in 1765, when the tax collector Zachariah Hood was injured while landing at the Annapolis dock, arguably the first violent resistance to British taxation in the colonies.\n After a decade of bitter argument and internal discord, Maryland declared itself a sovereign state in 1776.\n The province was one of thirteen colonies to declare independence from Great Britain and joined the others in signing a collective Declaration of Independence that summer.\n Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed on Maryland's behalf.\nColony of Tasmania\nThe Colony of Tasmania (more commonly referred to simply as \"Tasmania\") was a British colony that existed on the island of Tasmania from 1856 until 1901, when it federated together with the five other Australian colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia.\n The possibility of the colony was established when the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the \"Australian Constitutions Act\" in 1850, granting the right of legislative power to each of the six Australian colonies.\n The Legislative Council of Van Diemen's Land drafted a new constitution which they passed in 1854, and it was given Royal Assent by Queen Victoria in 1855.\n Later in that year the Privy Council approved the colony changing its name from \"Van Diemen's Land\" to \"Tasmania\", and in 1856, the newly elected bicameral parliament of Tasmania sat for the first time, establishing Tasmania as a self-governing colony of the British Empire.\n Tasmania was often referred to as one of the \"most British\" colonies of the Empire.\nCanada under British rule\nCanada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.\n Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.\n The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.\n With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.\n Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.\n A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.\n Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.\n Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.\n This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United

concerning the role of God in the universe in light of the Holocaust of the late 1930s and 1940s.\n It is primarily found in Judaism; Jews were drastically affected by the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered in a genocide by Nazi Germany and its allies.\n Jews were killed in higher proportions than other groups; some scholars limit the definition of the Holocaust to the Jewish victims of the Nazis as Jews alone were targeted for the Final Solution.\n Others include the additional five million non-Jewish victims, bringing the total to about 11 million.\n One third of the total worldwide Jewish population were killed during the Holocaust.\n The Eastern European Jewish population was particularly hard hit, being reduced by ninety percent.\n While a disproportionate number of Jewish religious scholars were killed, more than eighty percent of the world\u2019s total, the perpetrators of the Holocaust did not merely target religious Jews.\n A large percentage of the

party in Sweden, National Socialist Workers Party.\n But the cooperation between the two parties didn't last.\n Although both groups were staunch antisemites, their approaches toward the Jews were somewhat different.\n Rhedin, as a conservative Christian, was against the Jews as a religious community.\n NSAP were against the Jews as a race.\n Rhedin had no problem in accepting Jews who converted to Christianity, whereas NSAP and other nazi groups considered that converted Jews continued to be Jews in racial aspects.\n The party was closed down in 1936.\nMarcinkonys Ghetto\nMarcinkonys or Marcinkance Ghetto was a Jewish ghetto established in Marcinkonys, Lithuania, during the Holocaust.\n The ghetto was set up at the end of 1941 and covered the area of 1.5 ha ,

concentration camps.\n A squad of 15 Germans ordered the Jews to gather at the entrance at 8am to be \"transported for labor.\"\n Witnesses present different accounts of further events.\n According to an official complaint written by forester Hans Lehmann, two of the Germans opened fire at the crowded Jews without a reasonable cause.\n Other authors present the events as a revolt inspired by Aaron Kobrowski, chairman of the Judenrat.\n Panicked Jews attempted to escape through the fence into the nearby forest or back into the ghetto.\n The Germans then searched the ghetto, shooting any Jews on sight and destroying five secret bunkers.\n In total, 105 or 132 Jews were shot.\n About a hundred Jews escaped and 45 of them survived the war.\n Hans Lehmann, who had joined the Nazi Party in 1933, was investigated and it was determined that he was sympathetic to the Jews and allowed them to escape.\n He was discredited and transferred.\n In 1943, Jewish partisans derailed a German train east of

Reich.\nAdversus Judaeos\nAdversus Judaeos (Greek \"Kata Ioudai\u014dn\", \"against the Jews\" or \"against the Judeans\") are a series of fourth century homilies by John Chrysostom directed to members of the church of Antioch of his time, who continued to observe Jewish feasts and fasts.\n Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the synagogues in his city in a critical and negative light.\n There are modern scholars who claim that an abuse of his preaching fed later Christian anti-Semitism, and some, such as Stephen Katz, go even further, saying it was an inspiration for pagan Nazi anti-semitism with its evil fruit of the programme to annihilate the Jewish race.\n Indeed, during World War II, the Nazi Party in Germany abused his homilies, quoting and reprinting them frequently in an attempt to legitimize the Holocaust in the eyes of German and Austrian Christians.\n Christian priest James Parkes called the writing on Jews \"the most horrible and violent denunciations of Judaism to be found in the writings of a Christian theologian\".\n His sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.\n","problem":"Abraham Bankier was one of the owners of the Rekord factory that was taken over by a German Industrialist, spy, and member of the Nazi Party who is credited with saving how many

Similar evolutionary paths have been observed in elephants, hippopotamuses, boas, deer (for example Key deer) and humans.\nIrish elk\nThe Irish elk (\"Megaloceros giganteus\") also called the giant deer or Irish giant deer, is an extinct species of deer in the genus \"Megaloceros\" and is one of the largest deer that ever lived.\n Its range extended across Eurasia during the Pleistocene, from Ireland to Siberia to China.\n A related form is recorded in China during the Late Pleistocene.\n The most recent remains of the species have been carbon dated to about 7,700 years ago in Siberia.\n Although most skeletons have been found in bogs in Ireland, the animal was not exclusive to Ireland and was not closely related to either of the living species currently called elk - \"Alces alces\" (the European elk, known in North America as the moose) or \"Cervus canadensis\" (the North American elk or wapiti).\n For this reason, the name \"Giant deer\" is used in some publications, instead of \"Irish elk\".\n A study has suggested that the Irish elk was closely related to the Red deer (\"Cervus elaphus\").\n However, other phylogenetic analyses support the idea of a sister-group relationship between fallow deer (\"Dama dama\") and the Irish elk.\nColumbia Basin pygmy rabbit\nThe Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit is an isolated population of pygmy rabbit (\"Brachylagus idahoensis\"), that is native only to a single Columbia Basin area of Washington state.\n The Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit is the smallest North American rabbit.\n While the IUCN considers the species as a whole to be of least concern, the US Fish & Wildlife Service considers this a distinct population segment, and as thus merits protections under the Endangered Species Act.\n The last purebred Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit died in 2008, marking the end of the pure genetic line.\nPampas deer\nPampas deer (\"Ozotoceros bezoarticus\") live in the grasslands of South America at low elevations.\n They are known as \"venado\" or \"gama\" in Spanish and as \"veado-campeiro\" in Portuguese.\n Their habitat includes water and hills, often with winter drought, and grass that is high enough to cover a standing deer.\n Many of them live on the Pantanal wetlands, where there are ongoing conservation efforts, and other areas of annual flooding cycles.\n Human activity has changed much of the original landscape.\n They are known to live up to 12 years in the wild, longer if captive, but are threatened due to over-hunting and habitat loss.\n Many people are concerned over this loss, because a healthy deer population means a healthy grassland, and a healthy grassland is home to many species, some also threatened.\n Many North American birds migrate south to these areas, and if the Pampas deer habitat is lost, they are afraid these bird species will also decline.\n There are approximately 80,000 Pampas deer total, with the majority of them living in Brazil.\nMerycomyia\nMerycomyia is a genus of North American deer flies in the family Tabanidae.\nBog turtle\nThe bog turtle (\"Glyptemys muhlenbergii\") is a critically endangered species of semiaquatic turtle endemic to the eastern United States.\n It was first scientifically described in 1801 after an 18th-century survey of Pennsylvania.\n The smallest North American turtle, its carapace measures about 10 cm long when fully grown.\n Although the bog turtle is similar in appearance to the painted or spotted turtles, its closest relative is actually the somewhat larger wood turtle.\n The bog turtle can be found from Vermont in the north, south to Georgia, and west to Ohio.\n Diurnal and secretive, it spends most of its time buried in mud and \u2013 during the winter months \u2013 in hibernation.\n The bog turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on small invertebrates.\nPud\u00fa\nThe pud\u00fas (Mapudungun \"p\u00fcd\u00fc\" or \"p\u00fcdu\", Spanish: pud\u00fa , ] ) are two species of South American deer from the genus Pudu, and are the world's smallest deer.\n The name is a loanword from Mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuche people of southern Chile and south-western Argentina.\n The two species of pud\u00fas are the northern pud\u00fa (\"Pudu mephistophiles\") from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and the southern pud\u00fa (\"Pudu puda\"; sometimes incorrectly modified to \"Pudu pudu\") from southern Chile and south-western Argentina.\n Pud\u00fas range in size from 32 to tall, and up to 85 cm long.\n As of 2009, the southern pudu is classified as near threatened, while the northern pudu is classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List.\nThaumastocera\nThaumastocera is a genus of North American deer flies in the family Tabanidae.\n","problem":"What animal subject to the Foster's rule is the smallest North American deer?","answer":"Key deer"}

W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.\n A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer\/documentarian Frank E.

have vastly increased both the quantity and quality of what we know about ancient states and urbanism.\n Archaeologists have broadened the scope of their research beyond the traditional focus on rulers and urban elites.\n Current research now aims at understanding the role of urban commoners, craft specialists, and village-based farmers in the overall organization of ancient states and societies.\n Given the immense geographical scope encompassed by the term 'the Ancient World'\".\n The notion of a sovereign state arises in the 16th century with the development of modern diplomacy.\nFor earlier times, the term \"sovereign state\" is an anachronism.\n What corresponded to sovereign states in the medieval and ancient period were monarchs ruling By the Grace of God, de facto feudal or imperial autocrats, or de facto independent nations or tribal confederations.\n This is a list of sovereign states that existed between 500 BC and 401 BC.\nList of micronations\nMicronations, sometimes also referred to as \"model countries\" and \"new country projects\", are small, self-proclaimed entities that claim to be independent sovereign states but which are not acknowledged as such by any recognised sovereign state, or by any supranational organization.\n They should not be confused with microstates, which are recognised independent states of a small size, nor should they be confused with unrecognised states, which may have legitimate claim to sovereign state status.\nSovereign state\nA sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralized government that has sovereignty over a geographic area.\n International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states.\n It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\nLacu (musician)\nLacu (born in 1969 in Tampere as Kari Lahtinen), is a Finnish drummer best known for playing in the Finnish rock band Hanoi Rocks from their reformation in 2002 until his departure in 2008.\n He has also played with Popeda and Snakegod.\nSovereign immunity\nSovereign immunity, or crown immunity, is a legal doctrine by which the sovereign or state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution.\n It is a principle of international law which exempts a sovereign state from the jurisdiction of foreign national courts.\n Sovereign immunity is based on the concept of sovereignty in the sense that a sovereign may not be subjected without its approval to the jurisdiction of another sovereign.\n As Lord Atkin

{"context":"Vegetation classification\nVegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.\n Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.\n Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.\n In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.\n Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.\n Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.\nVegetation and slope stability\nVegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.\n The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.\n Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.\n There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.\nPavonia (plant)\nPavonia is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.\n The generic name honours Spanish botanist Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pav\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez (1754\u20131844).\n Several species are known as swampmallows.\nDesert riparian\nDesert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.\n It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.\n The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.\n The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.\n Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.\n Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\").\n Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.\n Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.\nCerastium\nCerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.\n They are commonly called mouse-ear chickweed.\n Species are found nearly worldwide but the greatest concentration is in the northern temperate regions.\n There are about 200 species.\n A number are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.\nTigridia\nTigridia , the peacock flowers, tiger-flowers or shell flowers, is a genus of bulbous or cormous plants, belonging to the family Iridaceae.\n They have large showy flowers and one species, \"Tigridia pavonia\", is often cultivated for this.\n The approximately thirty five species in this family grow in the Western Hemisphere, from Mexico to Chile.\n The tigridia flower is short lived, each often blooming for only one day, but often several flowers will bloom from the same stalk.\n Usually they are dormant during the winter dry-season.\n Its roots are edible and were eaten by the Aztecs of Mexico who called it \"cacomitl\" and its flower \"oc\u0113l\u014dx\u014dchitl\" \"Jaguar flower\".\n The genus name means \"tiger-like\" and alludes to the coloration and spotting of the flowers of the type species \"Tigridia pavonia\".\nPavonia lasiopetala\nPavonia lasiopetala is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family known by the common names that include Texas swamp-mallow, Wright pavonia, and rock rose.\n It is native to Texas in the United States and Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n in Mexico.\nBritish NVC community OV6\nBritish NVC community OV6 (\"Cerastium glomeratum\" -

the attention of the mainstream media.\n Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1\u20135 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4\u20138 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1\u20136).\n Additionally, the

Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta,

In service but non-commissioned Navy ships go by the prefix USNS, which stands for United States Naval Ship.\nLend-Lease\nThe Lend-Lease policy, formally titled \"An Act to Promote the Defense of the United States\", (Pub.L.\n 77\u201311 , , 55 Stat.\n 31 , enacted  11, 1941 ) was a program under which the United States supplied Free France, the United Kingdom, the Republic of China, and later the Soviet Union and other Allied nations with food, oil, and materiel between 1941 and August 1945.\n This included warships and warplanes, along with other weaponry.\n It was signed into law on March 11, 1941 and ended in September 1945.\n In general the aid was free, although some hardware, such as ships, were returned after the war.\n In return, the U.S. was given leases on army and naval bases in Allied territory during the war.\n Canada operated a similar smaller program under a different name.\nNew South Wales 79 class locomotive\nIn 1943, during World War II, four diesel-electric industrial shunting type locomotives built by General Electric Company, Erie for the United States Army Transportation Corps (USATC) were imported from the United States of America by the Department of Supply under Lend-Lease conditions for use at the Dunheved munitions factory in Sydney.\n They were four units of 58 units built for the USATC by General Electric numbered 8499-8528 & 7900-7929.\nUSS Enterprise (CV-6)\nUSS \"Enterprise\" (CV-6), was the seventh U.S. Navy vessel to bear the name.\n Colloquially called \"the Big E\", she was the sixth aircraft carrier of the United States Navy.\n A \"Yorktown\"-class carrier, she was launched in 1936 and was one of only three American carriers commissioned before World War II to survive the war (the others being \"Saratoga\" and \"Ranger\" ).\n She participated in more major actions of the war against Japan than any other United States ship.\n These actions included the Attack on Pearl Harbor (18 dive bombers of VS-6 were over the harbor, 6 were shot down with a loss of eleven men, making her the only American Aircraft carrier with men at Pearl Harbor during the Attack and the first to receive casualties during the Pacific War), the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, various other air-sea engagements during the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n \"Enterprise\" earned 20 battle stars, the most for any U.S. warship in World War II, and was the most decorated U.S. ship of World War II, She is also the first American ship to sink an enemy vessel during the Pacific War, the sole surviving pilot of the six planes shot down over Pearl Harbor sank Japanese submarine I-70 on 10 December 1941.\n On three occasions during the Pacific War, the Japanese announced that she had been sunk in battle, resulting in her being named \"The Grey Ghost\".\nHMS Willowherb (K283)\nDuring the first year and more after America entered the war against the Axis, the United States Navy suffered from an acute shortage of warships, particularly of antisubmarine warfare and escort types.\n To fill that need, an extensive ship construction and acquisition program was inaugurated.\n Part of that program consisted of placing orders with British and Canadian firms already tooled up to produce Flower-class corvette .\n Vitality\" (PG-100) was such a ship.\n However, before she was launched on 15 April 1943 by the Midland Shipyard in Canada, she was traded to the Royal Navy under the terms of the lend-lease agreement for a similar ship being constructed in Canada.\n The British renamed her HMS \"Willowherb, and she served in the Royal Navy for the duration of the war.\n On 11 June 1946, she was returned to the custody of the United States Navy.\n Though carried on the Navy list as PG-100 following the war, \"Vitality\" never actively served the United States Navy.\n She remained idle until sold on 7 May 1947.\n To whom she was sold and for what purpose is unknown, but one source indicates that she was not scrapped until 1961.\nPersian Gulf Command\nThe Persian Gulf Command was a United States Army service command established in December 1943 to assure the supply of U.S. lend-lease war material to the Soviet Union.\n Its history originated in September 1941, when the U.S. Military Iranian Mission led by Engineer officer COL Raymond A. Wheeler (later CG) was established to facilitate lend-lease supply to the U.S.S.R.\n At this same time, the Iranian District of the North Atlantic Division was set up to provide construction support.\n In August 1942 the mission was re-designated as the Persian Gulf Service Command, and in December 1943 became the Persian Gulf Command.\n It subsequently came under the command of a succession of engineer generals.\n Following the War Department\u2019s full militarization of construction, the Iranian District ceased to exist in May 1943.\n Three districts directly subordinate to the area command eventually replaced it.\n Eventually thousands of personnel worked in Iraq as well.\nUnited States Navy ships\nThe names of commissioned ships of the United States Navy all start with USS, for \"United States Ship\".\n Non-commissioned, primarily civilian-manned vessels of the U.S. Navy under the Military Sealift Command have names that begin with USNS, standing for \"United States Naval Ship\".\n A letter-based hull classification symbol is used to designate a vessel's type.\n The names of ships are selected by the Secretary of the Navy.\n The names are those of states, cities, towns, important persons, important locations, famous battles, fish, and ideals.\n Usually, different types of ships have names originated from different types of sources.\nUSS LST-594\nUSS \"LST-594\" was an \"LST-542\"-class tank landing ship , built for the United States Navy during World War II.\n The \"LST\" stands for Landing Ship, Tank, while the \"USS\" stands for United States Ship.\n \"LST-594\" was part of the second wave of LST's, denoted LST Mk.2's, which began production in 1943, replacing the earlier Mk.1 version.\n Within the Mk.2 version, there were three classes: LST-1, LST-491 and LST-542.\n The USS \"LST-594\" was a member of the 542 class, which had several operational and armament upgrades over the prior classes.\n","problem":"In what Australian city did the United States ship supplies in 1943 as part of the Lend-lease policy during WWII","answer":"Sydney"}

R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n Hansson had already composed and released a musical suite inspired by \"Watership Down\" on his previous album \"Attic Thoughts\".\n However, beyond its title, the \"Music Inspired by Watership Down\" album contains few overt references to the novel and instead features excerpts from the works of various poets, such as John Keats and Alexander Pope.\nMental Overdrive\nMental Overdrive is the primary solo moniker of Per Martinsen (born 31 July 1966), one of Norway's most prolific and influential techno musicians.\n His tracks have ranged from hardcore rave techno to vibrant space-disco, and he's always maintained a healthy balance of humor and braininess.\n Active since 1990, he began his career releasing several 12\" EPs of aggressive, rave-ready hardcore techno on revered Belgian label R&S, including 12000 AD (1990), The Second Coming (1991), Move!\n (as Confusion Club, 1991), and The Love EP (1992).\n In 1994, Martinsen began releasing atmospheric techno singles as part of Illumination, his duo with Nicholas Sillitoe.\n The next year, Mental Overdrive released the single \"Disto Disco,\" which featured a B-side (\"Faith\") co-written by R&S artist Outlander, best known for the 1991 classic \"Vamp.\"\n The A-side appeared on Mental Overdrive's full-length debut Plugged, released on Martinsen's own Love OD Communications.\n The album showed a notable progression in his music, maintaining its rough, distorted hardcore techno sound while adding more cerebral elements, placing it closer to Warp's Artificial Intelligence series.\n Martinsen displayed his sense of humor with 1996's Unplugged, a limited conceptual release containing silent \"versions\" of the tracks on Plugged.\n 083 In 1997, Mental Overdrive signed to Virgin and released About Jazz, a significantly more house\/disco-influenced EP than his previous work.\n This was followed by full-length Ad Absurdum, which continued in a more light-hearted and funky direction than his previous releases.\n He took a few years off from releasing Mental Overdrive recordings, instead devoting time to Frost (his more pop-focused electronic duo with his wife Aggie Peterson) and Illumination, which released two albums on RCA.\n Following the 2003 release of Mental Overdrive's Me EP on Love OD, he signed to Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound and released full-length 083, which featured the single \"Diskodans.\"\n In 2005, the label compiled his early R&S material on CD as The Phuture That Never Happened.\n Two years later, Mental Overdrive's single \"Spooks\" appeared on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label.\n The song appeared on his next Smalltown full-length, You Are Being Manipulated, which was released in 2008.\n The album was perfectly at home with the label's other left-field dance artists like Bj\u00f8rn Torske and Kim Hiorth\u00f8y, while maintaining the unique Mental Overdrive sound.\n Martinsen continued releasing Mental Overdrive singles on Full Pupp and Love OD, and contributed to Rune Lindb\u00e6k's Meanderthals project.\n In 2012, he released Man with a Movie Camera, an EP featuring music he'd composed for a 1996 screening of the Russian silent film of the same name, which also featured pieces by Biosphere which would later appear on the 2001 remaster of his classic album Substrata.\n Mental Overdrive returned to his Love OD label for 2013 full-length Cycls, as well as 2014's Everything Is Connected, which compiled a few previously released EPs.\n In 2016, Full Pupp sublabel Rett I Fletta released a new version of Plugged consisting of alternate takes sourced from the original DAT tapes.\n (Paul Simpson for allmusic.com)\nPolka\nThe polka is originally a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas.\n It originated in the middle of the 19th century in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic.\n Polka remains a popular folk music genre in many European countries, and is performed by folk artists in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and to a lesser extent in Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Russia, and Slovakia.\n Local varieties of this dance are also found in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latin America and the United States.\nThe Send\nThe Send was an alternative rock project of Falling Up ex-guitarist, Joseph A.
